# Collaborative Feature Implementation Solution

## Directory Structure
Here is how the directory structure should look for the solution:

```plaintext
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feature1.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feature2.js
```

## Implementation Details

### File: `src/components/feature1.js`
```javascript
// feature1.js

// Function for Feature 1
function feature1() {
  console.log("Feature 1 is implemented successfully!");
}

// Export the function for use
module.exports = feature1;
```

### File: `src/components/feature2.js`
```javascript
// feature2.js

// Function for Feature 2
function feature2() {
  console.log("Feature 2 is implemented successfully!");
}

// Export the function for use
module.exports = feature2;
```

## Merge Conflict Resolution

To resolve merge conflicts, ensure the files do not include conflict markers like these:

```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

Choose the correct changes to keep and delete all conflict markers.

## Testing the Solution

1. **Run Local Tests:**
   Test the functions by requiring them in a test file or logging the output:
   ```javascript
   const feature1 = require('./feature1');
   const feature2 = require('./feature2');

   feature1(); // Should log: Feature 1 is implemented successfully!
   feature2(); // Should log: Feature 2 is implemented successfully!
   ```

2. **Pull Request Checks:**
   Push the changes to your forked repository and open a pull request to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.

3. **Workflow Feedback:**
   If the implementation matches the requirements and no merge conflicts exist, the workflow will pass with the following feedback:

   ```plaintext
   ðŸŽ‰ Autograding complete! Great work! ðŸš€
